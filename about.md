I'm a **Data Scientist** in New York City. I grew up in California and spent my years in college until now in **NYC**.

Currently I am a **Data and AI Technical Specialist** at **IBM**, working alongside sellers and sales specialists in providing guidance and technical assistance/consultation to clients specifically in the data science and data governance domain.

I have a Masters of Science in Computational and Data Driven Engineering Mechanics from Columbia University. My courseworks had a focus on Data Science and Machine Learning.

Before that, I worked several years as an architectural designer after graduating with a Bachelors in Architecture from the City College of New York.
