I'm a Data Scientist in New York City. I grew up in California and spent my years in college and until now here in NYC.

Currently I am at IBM as a Data and AI Technical Specialist, working alongside sellers and sales specialists in providing guidance and technical assistance/consultation to clients specifically in the data science and data governance domain.

I have a Master of Science in Computational and Data Driven Engineering Mechanics from Columbia University. My studies had a focus on Data Science and Machine Learning.

Before that, I worked several years as an architectural designer after graduating with a Bachelors in Architecture from the City College of New York.
